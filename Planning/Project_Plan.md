# Aika AI System - Project Plan

## Overview
Aika is the primary orchestration agent for Aiko, an AI-powered insurance platform targeting hybrid workers, solopreneurs, and freelancers. Aika serves as the central interface between humans and a network of specialized AI agents that handle various aspects of the business operations.

## System Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Aika Orchestrator**
   - Primary entry point for all human interactions
   - Routes requests to appropriate specialized agents
   - Synthesizes responses from multiple agents
   - Maintains conversation context and user preferences
   - Manages authentication and user permissions

2. **Agent Network**
   - Research and Knowledge Management Agents
   - AI and Machine Learning Agents
   - Business Operations Agents
   - Insurance-specific Agents
   - Infrastructure and Monitoring Agents

3. **Infrastructure Layer**
   - Messaging Bus System (Apache Kafka/RabbitMQ)
   - Vector Database (Supabase)
   - Authentication & Authorization Layer
   - Monitoring & Observability
   - API Gateway

### Technology Stack

- **Core Framework**: LangGraph for agent workflow orchestration
- **Agent Implementation**: Pydantic AI for structured agent definitions
- **Vector Database**: Supabase for knowledge storage and retrieval
- **API Layer**: FastAPI for service endpoints
- **Messaging**: Apache Kafka for inter-agent communication
- **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 with JWT
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus and Grafana
- **Development Environment**: Integration with AI IDEs via MCP
