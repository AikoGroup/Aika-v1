## How to Use This Documentation

Each mini-version document provides:

1. **Implementation Steps**: Detailed breakdown of tasks to complete
2. **Testing Procedure**: Step-by-step instructions for testing
3. **Validation Criteria**: Clear metrics to determine success

For each mini-version:
1. Complete all implementation steps
2. Follow the testing procedure
3. Verify that all validation criteria are met
4. Document any issues or improvements
5. Proceed to the next mini-version

## Integration Testing

Each version document includes integration testing scenarios that validate how all mini-versions work together. These should be performed after completing all mini-versions for a particular version.

## Validation Process

Before considering a version complete:
1. All mini-versions must pass their individual validation criteria
2. All integration tests must pass
3. Documentation must be updated to reflect the implementation
4. Any issues discovered must be resolved or documented for future versions
